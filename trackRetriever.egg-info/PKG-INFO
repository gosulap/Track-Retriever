        # Track Retriever
        
        Built to make it easier for people to work with the tracks in their Spotify playlists 
        
        ### Prerequisites
        
        I assume that you have already made a Spotify project, if not you can do that [here](https://developer.spotify.com/dashboard/)
        
        ```
        You'll need your: username, client_id, client_secret, redirect_uri and userId 
        ```
        
        ### Installing
        
        ```
        pip install trackRetriever
        ``` 
        
        ## Functions 
        
        I made getPlaylistIds and get_playlist_tracks as helpers for getTracks but you are more than welcome to use them
        
        ```
        getTracks(username, client_id, client_secret,redirect_uri,getNames = False)
        
        All the parameters should be input as string except getNames
        When getNames is set to True getTracks will return a list of the names of the tracks in your playlists
        When getNames is set to False getTracks will return a list of the track id's of the tracks in your playlists 
        ```
        
        ```
        getPlaylistIds(playlists)
        
        This will get the playlist id's of your playlists 
        playlists = sp.user_playlists(userId) *userId is not your username* 
        ```
        
        ```
        get_playlist_tracks(userId, playlist_id,sp)
        
        sp is the spotify object created by spotipy.Spotify(auth=token)
        playlist_id is the id of the playlist you want to retrieve the tracks for 
        ```
